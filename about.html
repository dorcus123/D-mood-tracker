        <p>
            Hi there! i'm Dorcus.
        </p>
        <p>
            I created this app with one simple goal in mind: <br><strong>to help you tune in to your emotions and find balance in your daily life.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Life can be a rollercoaster,and sometimes, <br>just pausing to check in with ourselves can make a world of difference. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            Whether you're tracking your highs, navigating through challenges, <br>
            or just curious about your emotional trends, this app is here to guide you.
        </p>
        <p>
            As someone who believes in self-awareness and mental well-being, <br>
            I wanted to make this tool simple, personal, and uplifting. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope it inspires you to embrace every mood, learn from your feelings, <br>and discover more about yourself along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Thank you for joining me on this journeyâ€”your emotional well-being matters!</strong> 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>With gratitude.. Dorcus</strong>
